# LTE-Coverage-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a machine learning framework to predict LTE (4G) signal quality metrics—RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR—using models trained on suburban and urban environments. It evaluates and compares Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and Extra Trees for accurate signal prediction.
